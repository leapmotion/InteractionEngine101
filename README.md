# Interaction Engine 101 (Deprecated)
### This example is deprecated as it uses Interaction Engine 0.3.1. Please reference https://developer.leapmotion.com/unity/ for more information on the latest Interaction Engine.

>The project demonstrates what the Interaction Engine does in a playable tutorial (supports Oculus and Vive). The code for each example can be used as a reference for building your own projects that make use of the Interaction Engine to allow Leap hands to manipulate physical objects in Unity.

>When first opening the project, buttons may be missing references to their click sounds. Closing and re-opening the project will solve this issue.
