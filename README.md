# Interaction Engine 101 (Deprecated)
### This example is deprecated as it uses Interaction Engine 0.3.1. Please reference https://developer.leapmotion.com/unity/ for more information on the latest Interaction Engine

The project demonstrates what the Interaction Engine does in a playable tutorial (supports Oculus and Vive). The code for each example can be used as a reference for building your own projects that make use of the Interaction Engine to allow Leap hands to manipulate physical objects in Unity.

When first opening the project, buttons may be missing references to their click sounds. Closing and re-opening the project will solve this issue.
